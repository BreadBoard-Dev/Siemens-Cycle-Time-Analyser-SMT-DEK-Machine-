SCTA is a Windows desktop app that parses SMT printer logs to compute per‑stencil cycle times, downtimes, min/max/avg, and board counts, with instant Excel/Access reports and an Admin Panel for SMT line management and ODBC setup. Designed for factory PCs, it supports pyodbc with Microsoft Access ODBC Driver and runs real‑time analysis.
